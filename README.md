# React Pipeline

## What is this project?
This project was a personal idea to learn how to deploy a website from a GitHub repo to Vercel using GitHub Actions.
I also used this project to test the website before deploying to Vercel as preview.

I know, it's a simple project, but it was very useful to learn how to deploy to Vercel using GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started
### How to install locally?
First, you will need to have [Node.JS minimum version 18.X](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your computer.
After that, you will need to follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repo by using `git clone https://github.com/vboechat/react-pipeline.git`
2. Install dependencies by using `npm install`, `yarn install` or `pnpm install`
3. After that, you're ready to go, to start the project, you just need to run `npm run dev`, `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev`

### How to run tests?
To run tests, you just need to run `npm run cypress:run`, `yarn cypress:run` or `pnpm cypress:run`.

P.S.: If you want to open Cypress UI, just change from `cypress:run` to `cypress:open`.
